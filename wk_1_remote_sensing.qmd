# 1. An Introduction to Remote Sensing {.unnumbered}

This is a learning diary for week 1.\
Let's get started with remote sensing to explore our world üåè

## 1.1 Summary {.unnumbered}

### 1.1.1 Remote sensing üì°

-   Acquiring **information from a distance through sensors** such as satellites, planes(aerial imagery), drones etc. - e.g. satellites collect data on the same points on Earth every day to every 16 days.
-   Type of orbit
    -   geosynchronous orbit (GSO): satellite matches the Earth's rotation
    -   geostationary orbit: holds the same position

### 1.1.2 Types of waves „Ä∞Ô∏è

-   **An electromagnetic wave** has two components, *an electric field*(moving up and down) and *a magnetic field*(moving left and right).

    -   The two types of sensors with electromagnetic waves.

    +-------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+
    | **Passive** | use available energy\                  | Nothing                                               | Human eye, camera,\ |
    |             | (from the sun)                         |                                                       | satellite sensor    |
    +-------------+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+
    | **Active**  | have an energy source for illumination | emits electromagnetic waves and then waits to receive | Radar, X-ray, LiDAR |

-   **Electromagnetic radiation(EMR)** from the sun isn't automatically reflected. It interacts with Earth's surface and chchangesefore hitting the sensor.- e.g. being absorbed by the surface, transmitted through the surface, or (sunlight is) scattered by particles in the atmosphere.

-   **Sunlight**

    -   An electromagnetic wave emitted by the sun.
    -   The shorter the wavelength,
        -   the more robust the electromagnetic wave energy
        -   the bluer it is üåà
    -   **The visible colour usually changes** depending on *the distance* light reaches and the size of particles in the *atmosphere*.

    | **Visible light** | -   has a rainbow spectrum                                                                                      |

### 1.1.3 Light scattering & methods to gauge distance üìê

-   A phenomenon in which light with straightness is scattered in all directions by rough surfaces or tiny particles.

-   It makes **distance measurement difficult** (e.g. atmosphere, clouds) ‚Üí we need *alternative methods* to gauge distance

    -   Synthetic aperture radar (SAR): Polarization, Fluoresence

    -   Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF): reflects visible and invisible parts simultaneously depending on the satellite angle

    -   **Atmospheric correction**: remove what affected by the atmospheric scattering

        -   Low resolution means it has a large pixel size
        -   Four elements to decide the resolution of Remotely sensed data

        +-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+

        |                 | -   **lower the radiometric resolution, the lower the quality of the image** |                            |
        +-----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------+

## 1.2 Application

-   In forestry: Forest (soil) survey, pest damage investigation, forest fire damage investigation, tree species discrimination (confirming the distribution of coniferous or broadleaf trees) by taking seasonal aerial photographs.

-   In architecture: to crack down on illegal buildings or check the boundaries of buildings / cadastral lines.

-   to identify or prevent the degree of damage from natural disasters such as air pollution and floods.

-   to check time-series changes in distances or spaces at specific locations.

-   aerial photographs of famous tourist attractions are interpreted as artwork.

-   When **choosing the most appropriate sensor for the analysis**, the following factors should be considered: Size of features, date range, revisit requirement, spectral sensitivity, cost etc.

## 1.3 Reflection

I tend to check the location in advance with satellite images through Google Maps before I go to an unfamiliar place.

Learning about remote sensing data in Week 1 reminded me that I have been unconsciously using tremendously advanced technology so far, and I have not recognised it because it is commonly used. In addition, it also reminded me that I used annual aerial photographs to check the phenomenon of the urban sprawl of Suwon City when I worked in South Korea.

Considering that remote sensing data(e.g. aerial photographs) taken at equal intervals can soon be used as historical data for specific spaces, I thought it would be interesting to make future museums fill with 3D aerial photographs, not relics.
