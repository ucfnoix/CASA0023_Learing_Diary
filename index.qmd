Welcome to Eunyoung's diary ![](images/image-1680664414.png){width="18"}\

## **Who am I?**

-   It is my joy and why I study urban planning: the happiness many people enjoy in their daily lives in the space I created.
-   Cats save the world ![](images/image-665550276.png){width="16" height="17"}\
    Yes, she is a stray cat Sam-sae-gi in my house that I look after!

```

## **My background is...**

-   MSc., Urban Spatial Science, University College London, U.K.
-   B.A., Urban and Regional Planning, Dankook University, Rep. of Korea

I worked as a civil servant in the urban planning area for five years in Korea and also worked in real estate finance. I want to apply the knowledge I have learned in CASA to smart city initiatives and revitalise towns and agriculture in the countryside. (This is why I am taking this module for later üôÇ)

## **Special thanks to...**

Dr Andrew Maclachlan, for teaching us this amazing RSCE module! Making my own learning diary every week is the happiest time for me ‚úèÔ∏è

Okay, let's wrap up my brief introduction here and look around my diary now ![](images/image-106880547.png){width="15"}
