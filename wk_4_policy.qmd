# 4. Policy: 2025 Jeju Master Plan {.unnumbered}

This is a learning diary for week 4.\
I would like to find out how the environmental conservation policy of Jeju Island, South Korea is related to domestic and international plans and examine the recent illegal forest damage in Jeju Island and its solution.

## 4.1 Summary

### 4.1.1 How is Jeju? üèûÔ∏è

-   Jeju island is a representative tourist city in South Korea.
-   It is divided into residential, commercial, industrial, and conservation land. **In conservation land, four Gotjawal areas with unique vegetation are distributed. üå≥üå≤**
-   **Vegetation damage and increased Gotjawal erosion have recently occurred** due to the construction of cultivated land, various development projects such as golf courses, roads, and visitors.

### 4.1.2 2025 Jeju Master Plan

-   Creating an ecological map and building a GIS map
-   Introduction of **Total Environmental Resources System**
    -   The development and application of ecological area ratio indicators at the spatial planning level to comprehensively induce the maintenance and improvement of the ecological functions of urban spaces.
    -   Allow development activities after **creating alternative environmental resources** in case of environmental damage.
-   Designation of **'Ecological and Scenery Conservation Area'** under the Natural Environment Conservation Act ü¶Ö
-   Introduction of Landscape M.A. (Mater Architect) System and Landscape Advice System
-   Active utilisation and management of spatial information by linking **preservation ratings** (regulating development activities on Jeju island followed by ordinances) with GIS Source: [2025 Jeju Master Plan](https://www.jeju.go.kr/pub/skin/skin_v21.03.0/doc.html?fn=95ff2d28-8dba-4927-a65e-978c03bbb743.pdf&rs=/files/convert2020/202104/)

## 4.2 Application

-   **Illegal forest activities have recently increased**, especially in the Gotjawal area, such as forest damage, prohibited mountainous area exclusive use, illegal access road construction, and unauthorized logging. ü™µü™ì
    -   Monitoring and cracking down on various illegal activities in the forest **with aerial photographs using high-resolution drones**. üì∏

```

-   The local government of Jeju is currently establishing **a total environmental resources system**.

## 4.3 Reflection

-   63% of South Korea is mountainous areas, and it is necessary to preserve excellent natural scenery. Therefore, many local governments in Korea have recently established spatial information systems to utilise for forest preservation and a crackdown on illegal activities, etc.

-   Among them, Jeju Island is a UNESCO-certified nature conservation area. [World Natural Heritage Jeju](https://www.jeju.go.kr/jejuwnh/unesco/triple.htm#english)

| 2002                | 2007                          | 2010                    |

-   I have worked as a civil servant in Korea, and aerial photographs could not be used as legal proof when cracking down on illegal activities but were only a reference until a few years ago. However, the use of aerial photographs began to be legislated as the importance of using spatial information emerged.

-   Considering the development technology direction of remote sensing data I learned in class so far, the use of spatial information in policy will increase more and more. So, I thought I should also know how to use this information smartly.
