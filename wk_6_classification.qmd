# 6. Classification I {.unnumbered}

This is a learning diary for week 6.\
Let's find out how to analyse remotely sensed images, especially Land Use/Land Cover(LULC), with various ways!

## 6.1 Summary

### 6.1.1 How do we know? ðŸ¤”
Follow your intuition! We can make judgments or conclusions about specific knowledge from our experience. It is called **inductive learning** and can be leveraged to analyze remote-sensing images.

### 6.1.2 How does my computer know? ðŸ¤–
Like using human knowledge, **machine learning methods (Training data 70% : Testing data 30%)** based on **decision trees** are used to be learned how to find specific patterns in remote sensing data so that computers can judge themselves.

### 6.1.3 Different methods of classification

#### 6.1.3.1 Classification trees
 - classify data into two or more discrete categories
When we create a decision tree the final leaves might be a mixture of the categories = impure
We quantify this with the Gini Impurity

#### 6.1.3.2 Regression trees
 - predict continuous dependent variable 
 - Use the Sum of the Squared Residuals
 - Use the threshold that gives smallest SSR = always the lowest value (to prevent over fitting) = similar to gini impurity
  *Weakest link pruning

#### 6.1.3.3 Random forest
- supervised : Pattern recognition or machine learning / Classifier learns patterns in the data / Parametric (normal distribution) or non parametric (not normal)
- UnSupervised : clustering, k-means, ISODATA, cluster busting

#### 6.1.3.4 Maximum likelihood
: based on probability information

#### 6.1.3.5 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
