In addition, it also reminded me that I used annual aerial photographs to check the phenomenon of the urban sprawl of Suwon City when I worked in South Korea.\nConsidering that remote sensing data(e.g.¬†aerial photographs) taken at equal intervals can soon be used as historical data for specific spaces, I thought it would be interesting to make future museums fill with 3D aerial photographs, not relics."
