In particular, in terms of the Kernel trick, changing the dimension for data classification was really creative! 💡\nAlso, it was amazing that the SVM method separates data using hyperplane, and the classification results might vary depending on its type: Hard margin or soft margin.\nMany classification papers use Random forest and SVM methods both. But it doesn’t mean SVM is always the best method to use, even though SVM is the latest classification method.\nIt still takes work to fully understand the mathematical principles of each classification method (which makes me feel dizzy every time I learn it 🙄). However, it was worth remembering that the criteria that we intuitively thought and classified were developed for computers and applied for.\n\n\n\n\n\nDabija, Anca, Marcin Kluczek, Bogdan Zagajewski, Edwin Raczko, Marlena Kycko, Ahmed H.

Ten factors were computed for the logistic regression coefficient: slope, distance from drainage, soil type, land cover, etc. And then, the multivariate logistic regression model was applied and cross-validated for the three study areas.\nAs a result, Selangor showed the highest accuracy(94%), whereas Penang showed the lowest accuracy(86%) based on the same research area. In using cross-validation to improve accuracy, the case of Selangor based on the logistic coefficient of Cameron showed the highest (90%) prediction accuracy. It shows it is possible to get a meaningful result for preliminary landslide hazard mapping when using the cross-application model.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Biswajeet Pradhan\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3.

In addition, there was an overall high correlation at the higher latitudes compared with other satellite precipitation products, as shown in Figure 5c.\nIt has been found that this prediction can provide significant improvements to river flow forecasts downstream in Pakistan, a region with limited availability of ground based rain gauges and river discharge measurements."

We learned various (image) classification methods last week (week 6) and also learned how to check the accuracy accordingly this week (week 7). It was not that unfamiliar to understand for me because it was related to the spatial correlation I learned in the GIS module in the first term.\nIt was interesting that we can use machine learning technology for cross-validation by repeating each data differently. When it comes to Section 7.2.2, there are two noteworthy results: 1. There is no perfect single sensor for reliable flood monitoring. 2. However, utilising various remote sensing data can be the way forward in flood disaster risk reduction. It made me think again that it was up to researchers/people to decide how to use this technology.\nIn the case of the Kappa coefficient, it was surprising that it still continues to be used in formal research papers even though it is an accuracy measurement method that does not work well.\nI was also very interested to learn about the principle of sub-pixel analysis. I haven’t thought about the principle of image classification and how it works, but it is like a fun game after learning this concept! (p.s.

Ten factors were computed for the logistic regression coefficient: slope, distance from drainage, soil type, land cover, etc. And then, the multivariate logistic regression model was applied and cross-validated for the three study areas.\nAs a result, Selangor showed the highest accuracy(94%), whereas Penang showed the lowest accuracy(86%) based on the same research area. In using cross-validation to improve accuracy, the case of Selangor based on the logistic coefficient of Cameron showed the highest (90%) prediction accuracy. It shows it is possible to get a meaningful result for preliminary landslide hazard mapping when using the cross-application model.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Biswajeet Pradhan\n\n\n\n\nFig. 3.
